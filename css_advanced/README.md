# CSS Advanced Project - Get Schooled Website

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying CSS styling to a pre-existing HTML structure to recreate a given design from Figma. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in core CSS concepts and accurate implementation of a visual design.

## Learning Objectives (from the project requirements)

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain, without the help of Google:
* What is CSS
* How to add style to an element
* What is a class
* What is a selector
* How to compute CSS Specificity Value
* What are Box properties in CSS
* How does the browser load a webpage

## Requirements

* All files end with a new line.
* `README.md` file is mandatory.
* No external libraries (NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.) are used. Only pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
* Code is W3C compliant and validates with W3C-Validator.

## Design Source

The design for this project is based on a Figma file:
* [Link to Figma Page](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/3thRVDlJyov6Gphs_locXg) - *Crucial: Replace this with the actual link to your duplicated Figma file!*
* [Link to .fig file download]
